    "## What is Pandas?\n",
    "Pandas is a open source python library created to handle the manipulation and storage of large scale datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of using Pandas for Machine Learning\n",
    "- Pandas is optimized for handling large scale datasets\n",
    "- This optimization results in massive speedups when compared to other libraries like csv and pickle\n",
    "- Pandas contains several useful features for Machine Learning such as:\n",
    "    - Data cleansing\n",
    "    - Data inspection\n",
    "    - Statistical analysis\n",
    "    - Data normalization\n",
    "    - Loading and storing data\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a CSV file?\n",
    "A CSV file is a text file which uses a comma to separate values. An example is provided below\n",
    "\n",
    "id,title,city,postalCode <br>\n",
    "0,West-Varkenoordseweg,Rotterdam,3974HN <br>\n",
    "3,Ruiterakker,Assen,9407BG <br>\n",
    "8,Brusselseweg,Maastricht,6217GX <br>\n",
    "10,Donkerslootstraat,Rotterdam,3074WL <br>\n",
    "12,Vorselenburgstraat,Alphen aan den Rijn,2405XJ <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "While the above data might be difficult for a human to read at a first glance, machines can parse these files quickly\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why do we use CSV files?\n",
    "- CSV files are plain text files which can easily be manipulated using any text editor\n",
    "- The usage of commas to separate values ensures that the file behaves the same on all computers. This is useful when compared to a TSV file which uses tabs to separate values. Since the length of a tab can vary between different machines, the data may be read in an unintended way\n",
    "- CSV files are compact and can save space when used for large datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know what Pandas and CSV files are, we can get started with using them for our Machine Learning Purposes"
